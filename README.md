# 📊 End-to-End Data Analytics Project

## 🔎 Overview
This project demonstrates a complete **data analytics workflow** using Python, SQL, and Power BI.  
The goal is to transform raw data into meaningful insights through data exploration, cleaning, querying, and visualization.

The project follows real-world data analyst practices and showcases skills commonly required in data analytics and business intelligence roles.
